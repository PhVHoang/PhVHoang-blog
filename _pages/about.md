Greetings, I'm [Hoang Pham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hoang-pham-770010128/), a software and data platform engineer. 

Originally from Vietnam, I've had professional experience in Japan and Singapore before returning to Vietnam in mid-2023. Presently senior technical lead and lead data engineer at HCL/ANZ Bank.
