Hi there, my name is [Hoang Pham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hoang-pham-770010128/), I was born in Vietnam, had worked at Japan, Singapore and went back to Vietnam in the middle of 2023.

With over 5 years of experience, I specialize in backend development, data engineering, machine learning, and software infrastructure. My background includes constructing both monolith and large-scale microservices, particularly focusing on Data Platform, Data Lakehouse, and Cloud Native Applications.
